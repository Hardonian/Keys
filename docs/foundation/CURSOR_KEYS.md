# Cursor Keys

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-30  
**Status**: Canonical — Prompts as instruments  
**Purpose**: Create symbiosis with Cursor, not rivalry

---

## Core Principle

**Prompts are NOT content.**

**Prompts ARE instruments—structured, reusable patterns that unlock capability in Cursor.**

---

## What Are Cursor Keys?

**Cursor Keys are structured prompt packs and Composer instructions that unlock practical, repeatable capability in Cursor.**

### Key Properties
- **Tool**: Cursor (AI-powered code editor)
- **Format**: YAML, Markdown, or structured text
- **Outcome**: Unlock specific code generation, scaffolding, or workflow outcomes
- **Reusable**: Work across multiple projects, contexts, or sessions
- **Inspectable**: Clear structure, variables, and logic
- **Deterministic**: Produce consistent or bounded results
- **Artifacts**: Produce tangible code outputs (files, functions, tests)

---

## Cursor Is the Tool, Not a Competitor

### KEYS Doesn't Compete with Cursor
- ❌ KEYS doesn't replace Cursor
- ❌ KEYS doesn't build a competing editor
- ❌ KEYS doesn't hide Cursor's capabilities
- ❌ KEYS doesn't duplicate Cursor features

### KEYS Amplifies Cursor
- ✅ KEYS provides prompt packs that unlock advanced Cursor workflows
- ✅ KEYS provides Composer instructions that unlock scaffolding patterns
- ✅ KEYS provides templates that unlock consistent code generation

**Metaphor**: Cursor is the power tool. Cursor Keys are the jigs, templates, and guides that help you use it effectively.

## Why KEYS Amplifies Cursor

### Without Cursor Keys
- Users write prompts from scratch
- Users reinvent patterns
- Users miss best practices
- Inconsistent results across projects
- Slower time to value

### With Cursor Keys
- Users unlock proven patterns immediately
- Users leverage best practices
- Consistent results across projects
- Faster time to value
- Better code quality

### Symbiotic Relationship
- **Cursor benefits**: More users unlock advanced capabilities
- **KEYS benefits**: Cursor users become KEYS users
- **Users benefit**: Better outcomes with less effort

---

## Types of Cursor Keys

### Prompt Packs
**What**: Collections of proven prompts for specific outcomes  
**Format**: YAML files with structured prompt templates  
**Use Case**: Unlock consistent code generation patterns

**Example**: "Cursor Keys: Authentication Scaffolding"
- Provides prompts for JWT middleware generation
- Includes variable substitution for different frameworks
- Unlocks consistent auth patterns across projects

### Composer Keys
**What**: Mega prompts and instructions for Cursor Composer  
**Format**: `.prompt.yaml` files with comprehensive instructions  
**Use Case**: Unlock complex scaffolding workflows

**Example**: "Cursor Keys: Full-Stack SaaS Scaffold"
- Provides comprehensive Composer instructions
- Unlocks entire project scaffolding in one go
- Includes best practices and patterns

### Template Keys
**What**: Starter repositories and code templates  
**Format**: Repository structures, code files  
**Use Case**: Unlock project setup patterns

**Example**: "Cursor Keys: Express + Supabase Starter"
- Provides complete starter repository
- Unlocks proven project structure
- Includes configuration and setup patterns

## How Cursor Keys Work

### 1. User Owns Cursor
The user already has Cursor installed and configured. KEYS doesn't provide Cursor—it provides keys to unlock it.

### 2. User Selects a Key
User browses Cursor Keys in the marketplace:
- "Cursor Keys: Authentication Scaffolding"
- "Cursor Keys: Database Migration Patterns"
- "Cursor Keys: API Route Generation"

### 3. User Applies the Key
User downloads or applies the key:
- **Prompt pack** → Loads into Cursor's prompt system
- **Composer key** → Provides instructions for Composer
- **Template key** → Provides starter code structure

### 4. User Unlocks Capability
User uses Cursor with the key:
- Generates code using proven prompt patterns
- Scaffolds projects using Composer instructions
- Starts projects using template structures

**Result**: User unlocks practical capability in Cursor without reinventing patterns.

## Cursor Keys vs. Generic Prompts

### Generic Prompts
- Vague, one-off instructions
- No structure or reusability
- No best practices embedded
- No versioning or updates
- Tool-agnostic (work anywhere)

### Cursor Keys
- Structured, reusable patterns
- Best practices embedded
- Versioned and updatable
- Cursor-specific optimizations
- Tool-focused (optimized for Cursor)

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Authentication Scaffolding
**Key**: "Cursor Keys: JWT Authentication Middleware"  
**What It Unlocks**: Consistent JWT auth patterns in Cursor  
**How**: Provides Composer instructions that generate JWT middleware with best practices

**User Flow**:
1. User selects key in marketplace
2. User applies key to Cursor
3. User uses Composer: "Setup JWT auth"
4. Cursor generates middleware using key's patterns
5. User unlocks consistent auth capability

### Example 2: Database Migrations
**Key**: "Cursor Keys: Supabase Migration Patterns"  
**What It Unlocks**: Consistent migration patterns in Cursor  
**How**: Provides prompt packs that generate migration code with RLS policies

**User Flow**:
1. User selects key in marketplace
2. User loads prompt pack into Cursor
3. User prompts: "Create migration for users table"
4. Cursor generates migration using key's patterns
5. User unlocks consistent migration capability

### Example 3: API Route Generation
**Key**: "Cursor Keys: Express API Routes"  
**What It Unlocks**: Consistent API patterns in Cursor  
**How**: Provides template keys with route structures and patterns

**User Flow**:
1. User selects key in marketplace
2. User applies template to project
3. User uses Cursor to generate routes
4. Cursor follows template patterns
5. User unlocks consistent API capability
