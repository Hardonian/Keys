**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-30  
**Status**: Canonical — Permanent gatekeeping system  
**Purpose**: Gatekeeping system that ensures all contributions are valid keys

## Core Principle

**Every contributor must answer four questions. If they cannot answer, the KEY is rejected.**

## The Four Questions

Before any KEY can be accepted, the contributor must answer:

### 1. What tool does this key unlock?
- **Required**: Clear identification of external tool
- **Validation**: Tool must exist and be accessible
- **Rejection**: If tool is unclear or doesn't exist

### 2. What outcome does it produce?
- **Required**: Clear identification of practical outcome
- **Validation**: Outcome must be measurable and tangible
- **Rejection**: If outcome is vague or intangible

### 3. Why is this reusable?
- **Required**: Clear explanation of reusability
- **Validation**: Key must work across multiple contexts
- **Rejection**: If key is one-off or context-specific

### 4. Why is this not a blog post?
- **Required**: Clear differentiation from blog post
- **Validation**: Key must produce tangible artifacts
- **Rejection**: If key is advice without artifacts
