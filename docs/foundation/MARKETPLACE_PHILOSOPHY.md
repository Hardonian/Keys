# Marketplace Philosophy

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-30  
**Status**: Canonical — Defines marketplace as capability graph  
**Purpose**: Marketplace mechanics that reinforce learning and progression

---

## Core Principle

**The KEYS marketplace is NOT "where files are sold."**

**The KEYS marketplace IS "a capability graph where keys connect to tools, outcomes, and other keys, creating upgrade gravity."**

---

## Marketplace as Capability Graph

### Nodes: Keys
Each KEY is a node in the graph that:
- Connects to **tools** (which tool does it unlock?)
- Connects to **outcomes** (what problem does it solve?)
- Connects to **other keys** (what keys does it complement?)
- Creates **upgrade gravity** (what keys do users progress to?)

### Edges: Relationships
Edges represent relationships between keys:
- **Prerequisites**: "You need X before Y"
- **Complements**: "X works well with Y"
- **Upgrades**: "Y is the next step after X"
- **Bundles**: "X, Y, and Z work together"

### Graph Properties
The capability graph has:
- **Direction**: Keys have prerequisites and upgrades
- **Weight**: Some keys are more valuable than others
- **Clusters**: Keys group by tool, outcome, or maturity
- **Paths**: Users follow paths through the graph

## Why Bundles Exist

Bundles are not "buy more, save more" discounts.

Bundles are **capability clusters** that unlock complete outcomes:

### Example: SaaS Starter Bundle
- **Stripe Key**: Subscription management
- **Supabase Key**: Database setup
- **GitHub Key**: CI/CD workflows
- **Cursor Key**: Code generation patterns

**Together**: Unlocks complete SaaS starter capability

**Alone**: Each key unlocks partial capability

### Bundle Logic
1. **Complementary**: Keys work together to unlock complete outcomes
2. **Progressive**: Bundles unlock next-level capability
3. **Complete**: Bundles solve entire problems, not parts

### Bundle Value
- **Time**: Saves hours of finding and combining keys
- **Risk**: Reduces risk of missing critical pieces
- **Certainty**: Guarantees complete capability unlock

---

## Why Updates Matter

Updates are not "new features."

Updates are **living asset maintenance**:

### Tool Evolution
- Tools evolve (Cursor adds features, Stripe updates APIs)
- Keys must evolve to unlock new capabilities
- Updates keep keys current with tools

### Pattern Refinement
- Best practices improve over time
- Updates incorporate new learnings
- Keys get better with each update

### User Feedback
- Users discover edge cases
- Updates fix issues and improve patterns
- Keys become more robust

### Update Policy
- **Breaking changes**: Rare and explicit
- **Backward compatibility**: Old versions remain accessible
- **Changelogs**: Mandatory and detailed
- **Notifications**: Users notified of updates

---

## Why Ownership ≠ Static Download

Ownership is not "download once, use forever."

Ownership is **access to living assets**:

### What Ownership Includes
- **Current version**: Access to latest version
- **Update stream**: Automatic access to updates
- **Version history**: Access to all previous versions
- **Support**: Access to community and documentation

### What Ownership Does NOT Include
- **Redistribution**: Cannot resell or redistribute keys
- **Modification**: Cannot modify and resell keys
- **Competition**: Cannot use keys to compete with KEYS

### Subscription Model
- **Monthly/Annual**: Ongoing access to updates
- **One-time**: Access to current version + updates for 1 year
- **Enterprise**: Custom terms for organizational access

---

## Why Previews Are Instructional, Not Demos

Previews are not "try before you buy" demos.

Previews are **instructional previews** that teach:

### What Previews Show
- **Structure**: How the key is organized
- **Logic**: How the key works
- **Outcome**: What the key unlocks
- **Requirements**: What tools/knowledge are needed

### What Previews Do NOT Show
- **Full content**: Not the complete key
- **Executable code**: Not runnable examples
- **Complete workflows**: Not end-to-end execution

### Preview Purpose
- **Education**: Teach users what the key does
- **Evaluation**: Help users assess fit
- **Learning**: Show users how keys work
- **Trust**: Build confidence in key quality

---

## Marketplace Mechanics

### Discovery
- **Taxonomy filtering**: By tool, outcome, maturity
- **Search**: Full-text search across keys
- **Recommendations**: Based on user profile and history
- **Trending**: Popular keys and bundles

### Evaluation
- **Previews**: Instructional previews of keys
- **Reviews**: User reviews and ratings
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation for each key
- **Examples**: Example use cases and outcomes

### Purchase
- **Individual keys**: Buy single keys
- **Bundles**: Buy capability clusters
- **Subscriptions**: Ongoing access to updates
- **Enterprise**: Custom organizational terms

### Post-Purchase
- **Access**: Immediate access to purchased keys
- **Updates**: Automatic access to updates
- **Support**: Community and documentation access
- **History**: Access to version history

---

## Learning and Progression

The marketplace reinforces learning and progression:

### Starter → Operator → Scale → Enterprise
- **Starter Keys**: Learn the basics
- **Operator Keys**: Optimize workflows
- **Scale Keys**: Scale operations
- **Enterprise Keys**: Organizational deployment

### Tool Mastery
- **First Key**: Learn one tool
- **More Keys**: Master the tool
- **Cross-Tool**: Combine tools
- **Expert**: Become tool expert

### Outcome Achievement
- **Single Outcome**: Solve one problem
- **Multiple Outcomes**: Solve multiple problems
- **Complete Solutions**: Solve entire problem domains

---

## Marketplace Trust
