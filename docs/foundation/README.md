# KEYS Foundation Documentation

**Status**: Canonical — Governs all KEYS decisions  
**Purpose**: Permanent identity anchor and alignment system

---

## Overview

This directory contains the foundational documentation for KEYS—the immutable identity anchor and alignment system that governs all decisions, features, and contributions.

**These documents are not living documents. They are permanent anchors.**

---

## Core Documents

### 1. [KEYS_IDENTITY.md](./KEYS_IDENTITY.md)
**Status**: IMMUTABLE  
**Purpose**: Permanent identity anchor

The one-sentence definition, toolshed metaphor (explained once, never again), what KEYS is and is not, non-goals, and decision framework.

**Read this first. Refer to this for every decision.**

### 2. [WHAT_IS_A_KEY.md](./WHAT_IS_A_KEY.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Atomic unit definition

Defines what a KEY is in absolute terms: required properties, allowed forms, forbidden forms, and minimum acceptance criteria.

**Every contributor must understand this.**

### 3. [KEY_TAXONOMY.md](./KEY_TAXONOMY.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Universal classification system

Three-dimensional taxonomy (Tool × Outcome × Maturity) that enables discovery and creates upgrade gravity.

**Enforced at metadata, UI, bundling, and analytics levels.**

---

## Marketplace Documents

### 4. [MARKETPLACE_PHILOSOPHY.md](./MARKETPLACE_PHILOSOPHY.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Capability graph definition

Defines marketplace as capability graph (not file store), why bundles exist, why updates matter, why ownership ≠ static download, and why previews are instructional.

**Marketplace mechanics reinforce learning and progression.**

### 5. [JUPYTER_KEYS.md](./JUPYTER_KEYS.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Notebooks as first-class keys

Codifies notebooks as "Jupyter Keys" that unlock outcomes, not analysis. Protects notebooks from commoditization.

**Notebooks are keys, not special cases.**

### 6. [CURSOR_KEYS.md](./CURSOR_KEYS.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Prompts as instruments

Positions prompts as instruments (not content) that unlock Cursor. Creates symbiosis, not rivalry.

**Prompts are instruments. Cursor is the tool.**

---

## Economic & Legal Documents

### 7. [ECONOMICS.md](./ECONOMICS.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Pricing & economic moat

Defines value-based pricing logic, why KEYS replaces consultant hours, why bundles increase trust, and why subscriptions are updates.

**KEYS are underpriced vs. labor. Reusability multiplies value.**

### 8. [LICENSING_BOUNDARIES.md](./LICENSING_BOUNDARIES.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Legal defensibility

Formalizes licensing boundaries: tools are external, KEYS are original structure, licensing never contaminates core IP.

**Prevents future legal dead-ends.**

### 9. [UPDATE_POLICY.md](./UPDATE_POLICY.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Living assets system

Defines KEYS as living assets: updates are expected, old versions remain accessible, changelogs are mandatory, breaking changes are rare and explicit.

**Trust compounds faster than features.**

---

## Strategic Documents

### 10. [COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md](./COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Brutal pressure test

For each competitor class: what they do better, what they cannot do, why KEYS still wins. No ego. Only truth.

**Understanding competitors prevents vulnerability.**

### 11. [FAILURE_MODES.md](./FAILURE_MODES.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Guardrails and countermeasures

Explicitly documents how KEYS could fail (scope creep, tool replacement, over-automation, etc.) and lists countermeasures.

**Prevention is better than cure.**

### 12. [CONTRIBUTOR_RULES.md](./CONTRIBUTOR_RULES.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Permanent gatekeeping system

Every contributor must answer four questions. If they cannot answer, the KEY is rejected.

**Quality gate ensures all contributions are valid keys.**

---

## Summary

### 13. [FINAL_SUMMARY.md](./FINAL_SUMMARY.md)
**Status**: Canonical  
**Purpose**: Final verification and summary

One-paragraph immutable definition, one-sentence mantra, list of moats and how each compounds, one rule that must never be broken, and quality bar.

**Quick reference for core truths.**
